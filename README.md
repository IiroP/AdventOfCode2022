# Advent of Code 2022

*All solutions[^1] are made in Scala 3.* 

This was my first AoC, so I didn't know what to expect when I started. For some of the more complex tasks I looked for inspiration from Reddit, but I still feel like I've learnt a lot from this.

[^1]: I initially did day 9 in Python, but recreated it in Scala afterwards*
